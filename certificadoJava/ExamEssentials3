Be able to determine the output of code using String. Know the rules for concatenating
Strings and how to use common String methods. Know that Strings are immutable.
Pay special attention to the fact that indexes are zero based and that substring() gets the
string up until right before the index of the second parameter.

Be able to determine the output of code using StringBuilder. Know that
StringBuilder is mutable and how to use common StringBuilder methods. Know that
substring() does not change the value of a StringBuilder whereas append(), delete(),
and insert() do change it. Also note that most StringBuilder methods return a reference
to the current instance of StringBuilder.

Understand the difference between == and equals. == checks object equality. equals()
depends on the implementation of the object it is being called on. For Strings, equals()
checks the characters inside of it.

Be able to determine the output of code using arrays. Know how to declare and instantiate
one-dimensional and multidimensional arrays. Be able to access each element and know
when an index is out of bounds. Recognize correct and incorrect output when searching
and sorting.

Be able to determine the output of code using ArrayList. Know that ArrayList can
increase in size. Be able to identify the different ways of declaring and instantiating an
ArrayList. Identify correct output from ArrayList methods, including the impact of
autoboxing.

Recognize invalid uses of dates and times. LocalDate does not contain time fields and
LocalTime does not contain date fields. Watch for operations being performed on
