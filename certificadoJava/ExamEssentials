							Exam Essentials

Be able to write code using a main() method. A main() method is usually written as public
static void main(String[] args). Arguments are referenced starting with args[0]. Accessing
an argument that wasn’t passed in will cause the code to throw an exception.

Understand the effect of using packages and imports. Packages contain Java classes.
Classes can be imported by class name or wildcard. Wildcards do not look at subdirectories.
In the event of a confl ict, class name imports take precedence.

Be able to recognize a constructor. A constructor has the same name as the class. It looks
like a method without a return type.

Be able to identify legal and illegal declarations and initialization. Multiple variables can
be declared and initialized in the same statement when they share a type. Local variables
require an explicit initialization; others use the default value for that type. Identifi ers may
contain letters, numbers, $, or _. Identifi ers may not begin with numbers. Numeric literals
may contain underscores between two digits and begin with 1–9, 0, 0x, 0X, 0b, and 0B.

Be able to determine where variables go into and out of scope. All variables go into scope
when they are declared. Local variables go out of scope when the block they are declared
in ends. Instance variables go out of scope when the object is garbage collected. Class variables
remain in scope as long as the program is running.

Be able to recognize misplaced statements in a class. Package and import statements are
optional. If present, both go before the class declaration in that order. Fields and methods
are also optional and are allowed in any order within the class declaration.

Know how to identify when an object is eligible for garbage collection. Draw a diagram
to keep track of references and objects as you trace the code. When no arrows point to a
box (object), it is eligible for garbage collection.
