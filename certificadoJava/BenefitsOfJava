Benefits of java



1 Object oriented

	Java allows for functional programming within a class, but object oriented is still the main
	organization of code.


2 Encapsulation

	Java supports access modifiers to protect data from unintended access
	and modification

3 Platform independent

	Java is an interpreted language because it gets compiled to bytecode.
	“write once, run everywhere.”



4 Robust


	One of the major advantages of Java over C++ is that it prevents memory leaks.
	Java manages memory on its own and does garbage collection automatically



5 Simple





6  Secure

	Java code runs inside the JVM. This creates a sandbox that makes it hard for Java
	code to do evil things to the computer it is running on.
