/*Encapsulating data is helpful because it prevents callers from making uncontrolled changes
to your class.Another common technique is making classes immutable so they cannot be
changed at all.
you can pass them around your application with a guarantee that the caller didnâ€™t change anything.
This helps make programs easier to maintain
